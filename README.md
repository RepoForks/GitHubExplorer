# GitHub Explorer
Yet another github android client, add explorer and trending support
Please see the [issues](https://github.com/markzhai/GitHubExplorer/issues) section to
report any bugs or feature requests and to see the list of known issues.

## Why this

Because the official client of Github Android app does not support explore and trending, 
and I want to use some fancy libraries.
